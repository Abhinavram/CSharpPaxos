The goal of this project was just to let me understand Multi Paxos.
Now I do :) but this mean:

1/ The design isn't good as I discovered paxos as I go. I shouldn't have gone that road (especially mixing strategy/state/roles and messages)
2/ It should have been done in WCF or on top of existing framework if we wanted something really robust.

So this is just here for education purposes.
It's a piece of garbage, but it's working though!
